In order to run the project locally you have to run activator command:

./activator run

Note, that project requires MongoDB datastore provided by default on 127.0.0.1 host and 27017 port. However, you can customize it by adding parameters to run command:

./activator -DDB_HOST=custom_host -DDB_PORT=custom_port run

In order to enable debug along with run:

./activator -jvm-debug debugport run


In order to run on custom port:

./activator "run customport"

access project on http://localhost:9000 or http://localhost:customport

-------------DOCKER--------------------

In order to run project in docker, you have to have docker (preferable latest versions) and docker-compose (that supports version 3) to be installed on your local machine. 
In order to build image first via activator command:

./activator docker

Once, its done, you can check that the image with name 'sombrainc/docker-client:1.0-SNAPSHOT' appears in your local docker registry (run command 'docker images | grep docker-client').
After verifying the image existence, you have to run docker-compose command which will launch application and datasource containers:

docker-compose -f docker-compose-app-mongo.yml up

Check the application IP via command: docker exec -it dockerClient /bin/bash -c "cat /etc/hosts | grep dockerClient | awk {'print $1'}"

Then access from host via URL: http://containerip:customport/

-------------------API------------------

Create container API:

curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{"Image":"imageName", ...}" http://containerip:customport/containers

List all running containers:

curl http://containerip:customport/containers/running

Delete all containers by image name:

curl -XDELETE http://containerip:customport/containers/imageName
